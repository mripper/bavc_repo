<h1>
My name is Michael Ripper, and I am an avid collector of Fiestaware China. I first started collecting Fiestaware about 20 years ago with a good friend, and have managed to turn my once small collection into a hobby. I currently own over 150 pieces of dinnerware, including small saucers, large dinner plates, and bowls in a variety of colors, with 50 of those pieces vintage collectors items. I enjoy collecting Fiestaware as a hobby because it’s almost like an adventure for me. When I find a rare piece, it’s like finding a treasure. I also enjoy trading pieces with my friend to complete collections.</h1>

<h2>
  Why should you try out this hobby? I believe that any hobby should be about something that you enjoy, that you have a passion for, and that you will continue to appreciate your entire life. I would have never thought to have this affinity of collecting Fiestaware as a hobby, but I have always enjoyed the thrill of finding rare pieces and colors no longer in circulation, and putting together a collection to complete a set. At the end of the day, it gives me a sense of contentment in life. I now have enough complete collections to serve a party of 10! If you can relate, then you have found your new hobby as a Fiestaware Collector!</h2>

<h3>
  Here are some helpful steps on getting started as a Fiestaware Collector. Technology has made it easy to gain great information on the internet to aid in becoming a successful collector. Get to know the different pieces in the Fiestaware collection. Take note to the simple design, the variety of colors, and most importantly the makers stamp. There are a variety of stamps that have been used, so it is good to keep a visual memory of what each stamp looks like. I have included photos of the variations that have been used throughout time.
